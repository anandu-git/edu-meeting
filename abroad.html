                  </a>

                  <p class="description">
                    The sovereign state of United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland will take you through
                    its vast rich history of both industrial revolution and modern parliamentary democracy. The country
                    has become one of the most popular destinations when it comes to studying abroad with high quality
                    education system, and job opportunities all over. Since the nation comprises the land of England,
                    Wales, Scotland and North Ireland, it offers you with a perfect blend of multiple cultures. Its
                    capital city London, is one of the largest financial centers in the world and has wide opportunities
                    in arts, commerce, science and technology.


                    The nation has so much to offer to their international students with its institutions and
                    universities consistently ranked amongst the best in the world. UK has 4 out of the top 10
                    universities in the world and it has some of the oldest Universities in any English speaking
                    country. The world class education system and enumerable choice of courses with international
                    recognition has always flooded students to the nation.


                    Many of the universities in the UK have an eased eligibility criteria from accepting students with
                    backlogs to providing an IELTS waiver option for various courses. The requirements the students will
                    have to fulfill are less as compared to other countries. The courses offered are of shorter duration
                    than anywhere else in the world and thus provide value for both time and money spent in the country.
                    The international students also have the opportunity to work 20 hours per week during term time and
                    40 hours per week during vacations which favor them in meeting their living cost. Students here can
                    enjoy flexibility not only in terms of part-time work, but also enable them to blend their academic
                    courses with vocational interests like extracurricular activities.The UK has some interesting
                    courses that are also high on demand. But choosing the right one can mean taking into account
                    various aspects, or more precisely, the career prospects of the course rather than your liking of
                    it.


                    Studying in the UK has been the dream of many. Top universities and career prospects make it the
                    perfect destination for international students. However, Student visa applications can be a
                    troublesome task for the ones who have no experience on that front.


                    Universities of the UK also provide financial aid to their international students in the form of
                    scholarships.Commonwealth Scholarships, the Chevening Scholarships, Rhodes Scholarship are some of
                    the top scholarships available for international students. The educational system in the UK also
                    offers various health benefits to students in terms of free or subsidized medical treatment, all
                    making it the best destination for students who wish to study in UK.
